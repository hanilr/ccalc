# About The Project
If you a newbie and want to know how to make a calculator in c, this project for your purpose! Also I'm not a pro c coder so if you had a bug or issue please leave an issu to www.github.com/hanilr/ccalc/issues.
Without comments this project is only 103 lines. So if you use linux and want to use lightweight calculator for CLI also you can use. Even you can develop this project.
If you want to fork this project and develop then you want to sell, you can because this project lisence is MIT!

# Guide
### Help section:

### Math section:
> The logic of this program math is calculating as a template. For example if you typed 3 operation then first, second and third operations calculating with different buffer and then calculating as they symbol and value buffers then assigning to result value.

* Addition:
` ccalc + 1 2 ` or you can add multiple digit or number ` ccalc + 1 21 32 43 5 ... `

* Subtraction:
` ccalc - 1 2 ` or you can add multiple digit or number ` ccalc - 1 21 32 43 5 ... `
> Note: If you use multiple operating in program subtraction system little different. You need check to code!

* Multiplication:
` ccalc x 1 2 ` or you can add multiple digit or number ` ccalc x 1 21 32 43 5 ... `
> Note: Why did I use "x" instead of "*"?
> 
> Because compiler couldn't understand and I don't know why. If you know please share with me :)

* Division
` ccalc / 1 2 ` or you can add multiple digit or number ` ccalc / 1 21 32 43 5 ... `
> Note: If you entered a number that is not divisible by each other, the result may be 0.
